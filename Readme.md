# Compose Performance Playground

This repo plays around to analyze the stability and performance of Composables concerning:
- Stable/Unstable properties
- Lambdas

It also tries to compare the performance when using the better approach.
Composition inspection should be done along with the examples in this repo using Layout Inspector.

Also, this repo is closely linked to this article: [Jetpack Compose: Strong Skipping Mode Explained](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/jetpack-compose-strong-skipping-mode-explained-cbdb2aa4b900)
Right now the examples in this repo do not use "Strong Skipping Mode", and experiments without using this feature.

The plan is to experiment with "Strong Skipping Mode" soon in this repo.
